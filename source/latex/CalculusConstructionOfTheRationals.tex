    \[
        \nexists q\in\rationalnumbers \suchthat q^2 = 2
    \]
\end{snippettheorem}

\begin{snippetproof}{sqrt-two-irrational-theorem-proof}{sqrt-two-irrational-theorem}{\(\sqrt{2}\) is not rational}
    Assume \(\exists q\in\rationalnumbers \suchthat q^2 = 2\).
    Then, \(q = \frac{a}{b}\) for some \(a,b \in \naturalnumbers\) such that \(\gcd(a,b)=1\).
    We have that \(q^2 = a^2 / b^2 = 2\) and thus \(a^2 = 2b^2\).
    This means that \(a^2\) is even and thus \(a\) is also even.
    Since \(a\) is even, \(a = 2k\) for some \(k\in\naturalnumbers\).
    We now have that \(4k^2 = 2b^2\) meaning \(2k^2 = b^2\).
    This means that \(b^2\) is even and thus \(b\) is even, but
    \(a\) and \(b\) are \coprime\,\lightning.
\end{snippetproof}
