    {Who is Safie?}
    She is a Turkish girl whose father, a rich merchant, was accused and
    imprisoned, but who escaped thanks to Felix.
    He and Safie, eventually, fall in love, 
    and she returns back to him even if he's now poor.

    {How does Safie's arrival benefit the monster? What does he learn about the human race?}
    Since she has to learn everything (language, culture, ...)
    the monster can follow the lessons given to her and learn as well.
    He learns that people can both read and speak the same language,
    history, human relationships,
    and that in order to be someone or to mean something in a society
    people require money, property, friends and such.
\end{snippetexercise}

\begin{snippetexercise}{frankenstein-ex-26}
    {What is the significance of Safie's backstory to the novel?}
    Sofia is like the monster; outsiders.
    She's pushes aside, doesn't have control over her life.
