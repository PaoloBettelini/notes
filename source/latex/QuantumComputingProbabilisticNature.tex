    A qubit is comprable to a bit in the \quotes{classical} world, but it exists on a sub-atomic level. \\
    When a qubit is measured, its state will either be a \quotes{1} or a \quotes{0}. \\
    The crucial aspect is that before the measurement, a qubit is in a \textit{superposition} of both states.
    
    For example, a given qubit \(|\Psi\rangle\) can be represented as
    \[
        |\Psi\rangle=\alpha |0\rangle+\beta |1\rangle
    \]
    which means a linear combination of the two states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\).
    
    The coefficients \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) represent the probability of the qubit collapsing into one of the two states when measured.
    The probability of the qubit collapsing into \(|0\rangle\) is \(|\alpha|^2\),
    while the probability of collapsing into \(|1\rangle\) is \(|\beta|^2\). \\
    Since there is \(100\%\) chance of the qubits collapsing into one of the two states, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) must satisfy the following requirement:
    \[
        |\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1
    \]
    
    A uniform superposition of the two states looks like this:
    \[
        |\Psi\rangle=\frac{|0\rangle+|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
    \]
    which means that we have \(50\%\) probability of the state collapsing into a \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\)
    since \({\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}^2=\frac{1}{2}\).
    
    When the qubit is measured, the superposition is destroyed, leaving it in a \quotes{classical} binary state.
    
    You mght have noticed that I used the absolute value in \(|\alpha|^2\) or \(|\beta|^2\), which doesn't usually make sense since squaring the value is already going to give us a positive result.
    \\
    This is because the coefficients \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) can also be complex numbers. The absolute value of a complex number is defined as its distance from the origin.
    
    The states \(|1\rangle\) and \(|0\rangle\) can also be written as \(|+\rangle\) and \(|-\rangle\).
