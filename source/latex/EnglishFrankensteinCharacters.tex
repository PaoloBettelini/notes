\begin{snippetcharacter}{frankenstein-victor-frankenstein}{Victor Frankenstein}
    The doomed protagonist and narrator of the main portion of the story. Studying in Ingolstadt, Victor discovers the secret of life and creates an intelligent but grotesque monster, from whom he recoils in horror. Victor keeps his creation of the monster a secret, feeling increasingly guilty and ashamed as he realizes how helpless he is to prevent the monster from ruining his life and the lives of others.
\end{snippetcharacter}

\begin{snippetcharacter}{frankenstein-the-monster}{The Monster}
    The eight-foot-tall, hideously ugly creation of Victor Frankenstein. Intelligent, eloquent, and sensitive, the Monster attempts to integrate himself into human social patterns, but all who see him shun him. His feeling of abandonment compels him to seek revenge against his creator.
\end{snippetcharacter}

\begin{snippetcharacter}{frankenstein-robert-walton}{Robert Walton}
    The Arctic seafarer whose letters open and close Frankenstein. Walton picks the bedraggled Victor Frankenstein up off the ice, helps nurse him back to health, and hears Victor's story. He records the incredible tale in a series of letters addressed to his sister, Margaret Saville, in England.
\end{snippetcharacter}

\begin{snippetcharacter}{frankenstein-elizabth-lavenza}{Elizabeth Lavenza}
    An orphan, four to five years younger than Victor, whom the Frankensteins adopt. In the 1818 edition of the novel, Elizabeth is Victor's cousin, the child of Alphonse Frankenstein's sister. In the 1831 edition, Victor's mother rescues Elizabeth from a destitute peasant cottage in Italy. Elizabeth embodies the novel's motif of passive women, as she waits patiently for Victor's attention.
\end{snippetcharacter}

\begin{snippetcharacter}{frankenstein-henry-clerval}{Henry Clerval}
    Victor's boyhood friend, who nurses Victor back to health in Ingolstadt. After working unhappily for his father, Henry begins to follow in Victor's footsteps as a scientist. His cheerfulness counters Victor's moroseness.

\end{snippetcharacter}
