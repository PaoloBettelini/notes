\section{Kepler's laws of planetary motion}

\begin{snippettheorem}{keplers-laws-theorem}{Kepler's laws of planetary motion}
    Kepler's laws of planetary motion state:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
        \item A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
        \item The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{snippettheorem}
