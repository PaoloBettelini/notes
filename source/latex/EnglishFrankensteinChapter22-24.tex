    {What does Frankenstein ask Walton to do for him before he dies?}
    He asks him to kill the monster if he wouldn't have been able 
    do it himself before his death. 
\end{snippetexercise}

\begin{snippetexercise}{frankenstein-ex-44}
    {What does Frankenstein tell Walton and the other sailors when Walton decides to eventually
    return to England rather than completing his mission? What does Frankenstein's speech to the
    sailors tell us about his character?}
    He tells them that they're cowards and they have to keep going for the sake
    of glory. This passage makes us understand that F. is slightly contradicting himself
    because he wants them to continue the mission but not be ambitious.
\end{snippetexercise}

\begin{snippetexercise}{frankenstein-ex-45}
    {What does the creature tell Walton at the end of the novel?}
    He tells him that he didn't like killing all those people but he acted that
    way because he didn't receive comprehension by human beings, only because
    he's ugly. He says that he was a beautiful creature inside but people only look
    at appearances.
