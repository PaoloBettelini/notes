        If I was a wife I would make a man happy instead of goin' at him all the time. I can tell a
        block away when he's blue in his mind and just wants to talk to somebody quiet and
        niceâ€¦ I can tell when he's hungry or wants a beer before he even says anything. I know
        when his feet hurt him, I mean I know him and now I'm supposed to turn around and
        make a stranger out of him? I don't know why I have to do that, I mean.
