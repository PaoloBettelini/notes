\section{Kernel of a group}

\begin{snippet}{group-homomorphism-preserves-subgroup-particular-cases}
    In the trivial cases where we consider \(1_G\) and \(G\) as the \subgroup[subgroups]
    of \(G\), we have \(\varphi(1_G)\) and \(\varphi(G)\) are \subgroup[subgroups]
    of \(G\). The case \(\varphi(1_G) = 1_H\) is not particularly interesting.
    The case \(\varphi(G) = \text{Im}\{\varphi\}\), meaning that the image of a \grouphomomorphism
    is a \subgroup. Now consider \(1_H\) and \(H\) as \subgroup[subgroups]
    of \(H\). We thus have \(\varphi^\inversefunction(1_H)\) and \(\varphi^\inversefunction(H)\),
    which are \subgroup[subgroups] of \(G\). The second case is not interesting as
    \(\varphi^\inversefunction(H) = G\). In the first case we only have a specific \subgroup.
\end{snippet}

\begin{snippetdefinition}{group-kernel-definition}{Kernel}
    Let \(\varphi \colon G \fromto H\) be a \grouphomomorphism.
    The \emph{kernel} of \(\varphi\), is defined as
    \[
        \text{ker}_\varphi \triangleq \{x\in G \suchthat \varphi(x) = 1_H\}
    \]
\end{snippetdefinition}

\begin{snippettheorem}{kernel-equivalent-properties-theorem}{Kernel lateral properties}
    Let \(\varphi \colon G \fromto H\) be a \grouphomomorphism
    and let \(x,y \in G\). The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item \(\varphi(x) = \varphi(y)\);
        \item \(\grpker_\varphi x = \grpker_\varphi y\);
        \item \(x\,\grpker_\varphi = y\,\grpker_\varphi\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{snippettheorem}

\plain{In the kernel, the right and left laterals are the same.}

\begin{snippetproof}{kernel-equivalent-properties-theorem-proof}{kernel-equivalent-properties-theorem}{Kernel lateral properties}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \((1) \implies (2)\): consider \(k = xy^{-1}\). We have that
        \[\varphi(k) = \varphi(xy^{-1}) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y^{-1}) = (\varphi(x)){(\varphi(x))}^{-1}\]
        and thus \(k \in \grpker_\varphi\). Now, \(x = xy^{-1}y = ky \in \grpker_\varphi y\).
        and thus \(\grpker_\varphi x = \grpker_\varphi y\).
        \item \((2) \implies (1)\): we know that \(\grpker_\varphi x = \grpker_\varphi y\) and thus
        \(x = ky\) for some \(k\in \grpker_\varphi\). But then,
        \[
            \varphi(x) = \varphi(ky) = \varphi(k) \varphi(y) = 1_H \varphi(y) = \varphi(y)
        \]
        \item \((1) \implies (3)\): analogous;
        \item \((3) \implies (1)\): analogous.
    \end{itemize}
\end{snippetproof}

\begin{snippetcorollary}{homomorphism-injectivity-equivalence}{Homomorphism injectivity}
    Let \(\varphi \colon G \fromto H\) be a \grouphomomorphism.
    Then, \(\varphi\) is \injective \ifandonlyif \(\grpker_\varphi\) is trivial.
\end{snippetcorollary}

\begin{snippetproof}{homomorphism-injectivity-equivalence-proof}{homomorphism-injectivity-equivalence}{Homomorphism injectivity}
    \iffproof{
        Let \(x \in \grpker_\varphi\). We have that
        \(\varphi(x) = 1_H = \varphi(1_G)\), since the \grouphomomorphism is \injective
        we find \(x = 1_G\).
    }{
        Let \(x,y \in G\) such that \(\varphi(x) = \varphi(y)\).
        By \snippetref[kernel-equivalent-properties-theorem][this theorem],
        they are both in the same (right) lateral. Since \(\grpker_\varphi\)
        is trivial, there is only one element in the lateral, meaning \(x=y\).
    }
\end{snippetproof}

\plain{We do not define the kernel of a monoid analogously to the one of a group.
Such a definition would still be a submonoid, but if the kernel only contained the identity,
that would not imply that the homomorphism is injective (only the other way around).}

\begin{snippetexample}{monoid-homomorphism-kernel-example}{}
    Consider \((\integers \difference \{-1\}, \cdot)\)
    and the \monoidhomomorphism to the integers where \(\varphi(x) \triangleq x^2\).
    We have that \(\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x) \varphi(y)\).
    However, \(\varphi\) is not \injective. Only the element \(1\) goes into the identity,
    but the \function is not \injective like it would be in a \group.
\end{snippetexample}

\begin{snippettheorem}{generated-subgroup-homomorphism-theorem}{Generated subgroup homomorphism}
    Let \(\varphi \colon G \fromto H\) be a \grouphomomorphism
    and let \(X \subseteq G\). Then,
    \[
        \varphi(\gengrp{X}) = \gengrp{\varphi(X)}
    \]
    If \(Y \subseteq H\), it is not guaranteed that
    \[
        \varphi^\inversefunction(\gengrp{Y}) = \gengrp{\varphi^\inversefunction(Y)}
    \]
\end{snippettheorem}

\plain{The same with the inverse operation is not necessarily true.}

\begin{snippetproof}{generated-subgroup-homomorphism-theorem-proof}{generated-subgroup-homomorphism-theorem}{Generated subgroup homomorphism}
    If \(X = \emptyset\), we know \(\gengrp{X} = 1_G\) and, thus,
    \(\varphi(\gengrp{X}) = 1_H\). On the other hand, \(\gengrp{\varphi(X)} = 1_H\).
    Otheriwse, \(X \neq \emptyset\). We know that the element of \(\gengrp{X}\)
    have the form \(x_1\circ x_2 \cdots x_r\) where \(x_i \in X\) or \(x_i^{-1} \in X\).
    Now,
    \begin{align*}
        \varphi(\gengrp{X}) &= \{\varphi(x_1 \circ x_2 \cdots x_r) \suchthat
        x_i \in X \lor x_i^{-1} \in X\} \\
        &= \{ \varphi(x_1) \circ \varphi(x_2) \circ \varphi(x_r) \suchthat
        \varphi(x_i) \in \varphi(X) \lor \varphi(x_i^{-1}) \in \varphi(X) \} \\
        &= \{ \varphi(x_1) \circ \varphi(x_2) \circ \varphi(x_r) \suchthat
        \varphi(x_i) \in \varphi(X) \lor {(\varphi(x_i))}^{-1} \in \varphi(X) \} \\
        &= \gengrp{\varphi(X)}
    \end{align*}
    Let now \(Y \subseteq H\). We construct an example to show that the property does not hold
    necessarily. Consider
    \[
        \varphi\colon (\integers, +) \fromto \permgrp_3
    \]
    defined as \(\varphi(n) \triangleq {\kcycle{1, 2, 3}}^n\) which is a \grouphomomorphism.
    Also, consider \(Y = \{\kcycle{1,2}\}\).
    Thus, \(\gengrp{Y} = \{\text{Id}, \kcycle{1,2}\}\).
    On the other hand, \(\varphi^\inversefunction(Y) = \emptyset\)
    as now 3-cycle raised to a power will result in a \permswap.
    Thus, \(\gengrp{\varphi^\inversefunction(Y)} = \emptyset\).
    However, \(\varphi^\inversefunction(\gengrp{Y}) = 3\integers\).
\end{snippetproof}

\begin{snippetcorollary}{generated-subgroup-homomorphism-particular-case}{}
    Let \(\varphi \colon G \fromto H\) be a \grouphomomorphism
    and let \(g\in G\). Then,
    \[
        \varphi(\gengrp{g}) = \gengrp{\varphi(g)}
    \]
    Furthermore, if \(g\) has finite period, \(|\varphi(\gengrp{g})|\) divides
    \(|\gengrp{g}|\).
\end{snippetcorollary}

\begin{snippetproposition}{generated-subgroup-homomorphism-reverse}{}
    Let \(\varphi \colon G \fromto H\) be a \grouphomomorphism
    and let \(Y \subseteq H\). Then,
    \[
        \gengrp{\varphi^\inversefunction(Y)} \subgroupleq
        \varphi^\inversefunction(\gengrp{Y})
    \]
